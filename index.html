                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Our ocean is in serious trouble. Heating, pollution, acidification, and oxygen loss pose serious threats to the health of the ocean and to all living beings who call this vast planetary resource their home. Why should you care? Here are 5 reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The ocean feeds us</li>
                    <li>It provides jobs and livelihoods</li>
                    <li>The ocean is a tool for economic development</li>
                    <li>We need a healthy ocean to survive</li>
                    <li>The ocean regulates our climate and provides the air we breathe</li>
                  </ul>

            <p>Let us explore some of the endangered Animals:</p>

                <img src="seaturtle.jpg" alt="Sea Turtle">
                <p>Human activities have shifted the odds against the survival of these ancient mariners over the past 200 years. Sea turtles are killed for their eggs, flesh, skin, and shells, and they are overfished and subject to poaching. In addition, their habitat is being destroyed, and bycatch—accidental capture—in fishing gear is a problem. Climate change influences turtle nesting locations by changing the temperature of the sand, which subsequently has an impact on the sex of the hatchlings. Almost all sea turtle species are currently considered to be endangered, with three of the seven recognized species being in grave danger.</p>

            <div class="picture">
                <img src="humpheadwrasse.jpg" alt="Humphead Wrasse">
                <p>The humphead wrasse is an enormous coral reef fish—growing over six feet long—with a prominent bulge on its forehead. The Coral Triangle's local governments are urged by WWF to prohibit the trading and consumption of humphead wrasse, one of the world's most costly live reef fish. Due to the fact that poachers frequently use legal and damaging fishing methods to obtain them, the live reef fish trade in Southeast Asia continues to be a serious issue that endangers both the region's food security and its reefs.

                <img src="vaquita.jpg" alt="Vaquita">
                <p>Vaquita, the world's rarest marine mammal, is on the edge of extinction. The swift extinction of the vaquita in Mexico, where there are now just around 10 individuals left, is a prime example of the situation of cetaceans—whales, dolphins, and porpoises—as a whole. It wasn't until 1958 that this tiny porpoise was found, and now, a little more than 50 years later, we are in danger of losing them forever. Gillnets are frequently employed by illicit fishing operations in Mexico's Gulf of California to catch and drown vaquita. In the most recent few years, the population has substantially decreased.</p>
